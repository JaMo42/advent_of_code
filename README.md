# Advent of Code 2021

## Running

For day `D`:

```shell
./run D [-example]
```

`D` can either be just a number (for example `7`) or a number and a part (for example `1_2`),
The first number of this sequence is used to determine the input file.
The example data can be used with the `-example` option.
If no executable for the day exists, the script will try to build it.
